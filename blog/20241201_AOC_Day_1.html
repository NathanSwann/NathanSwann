<div id="content" style="width:70%;margin:auto;text-align:justify">
<p>With December beginning, we are once again graced with the Advent of Code: a daily coding challenge crafted by whimsical elves. And what better way to tackle these devious puzzles than with KDB/Q? Today’s problem revolves around comparing and transforming lists. I would encourage you to check out <a href="https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/1">todays full text</a> and give it a go yourself. Spoilers Ahead.</p>
<h1 id="part-1">Part 1</h1>
<p>In Part 1, we are tasked with sorting two lists and calculating the sum of their element-wise differences. This is straightforward, there are multiple ways to solve it in KDB. Let’s walk through them.</p>
<p>First, we need to parse the input. A slight wrinkle is that the numbers are separated by three spaces, which means <code>0:</code> won’t work out of the box. Instead, we can use <code>vs</code> to split each line into parts and cast them to longs. While we’re at it, we’ll use <code>flip</code> to transform our input into two separate lists:</p>
<pre class="q"><code>q)inp:flip&quot;J&quot;$&quot;   &quot;vs/:read0`:data/1
q)inp
3 4 2 1 3 3
4 3 5 3 9 3</code></pre>
<p>Now we need to pair up our elements from smallest to largest, for this we can use <code>asc</code>. Next we need to calculate the difference. There are a few ways to do this e.g. <code>-/</code> or taking the last of <code>deltas</code> but I want to highlight a favourite. We can use apply <code>.</code> along with <code>(-)</code>. You may wonder why we cant just do <code>-.</code> and the primary reason is that on the left we need <code>-</code> to act as a noun rather than a verb, by wrapping it in brackets KDB will now treat it as a noun.</p>
<pre class="q"><code>q)sum abs(-). asc each inp
11</code></pre>
<h2 id="minor-diversion-to-qsql">Minor Diversion to QSQL</h2>
<p>Alternatively, we can solve this problem using QSQL and tables. To do this, we need to structure our <code>inp</code> data as a table rather than a flipped list. Here’s how we can transform the input into a table format:</p>
<pre class="q"><code>q)inptab:([]lista:`long$();listb:`long$())upsert&quot;J&quot;$&quot;   &quot;vs/:read0`:data/1
q)inptab
lista listb
-----------
3     4
4     3
2     5</code></pre>
<p>With the data in a table, we can use a single select statement to calculate the sum of absolute differences between the sorted lists:</p>
<pre class="q"><code>q)select sum abs asc[lista]-asc listb from inptab
lista
-----
11</code></pre>
<p>Both the table-based approach and the list-based approach are comparable in terms of performance, so it largely comes down to preference. For day-to-day tasks, I find the table-based version to be slightly more readable and intuitive, especially when working with more data.</p>
<p>Here’s a quick comparison of their performance:</p>
<pre class="q"><code>q)\t:1000 sum abs(-). asc each inp
25
q)\t:1000 select sum abs asc[lista]-asc listb from inptab
26</code></pre>
<h1 id="part-2">Part 2</h1>
<p>In Part 2, the task changes slightly: we need to calculate the sum of the elements in list a multiplied by their frequencies in list b. Let’s start by using the table-based approach to solve this.</p>
<p>To determine the frequencies of elements in list b, we can use a <code>count by</code> query:</p>
<pre class="q"><code>q)select c:count i by listb from inptab
listb| c
-----| -
3    | 3
4    | 1</code></pre>
<p>Now that we have the frequencies, we can perform a left join (<code>lj</code>) to combine them with the main table and compute the desired sum. One detail to note: we need to rename the key in the frequency table (listb) to match the lista column in the main table before joining. Here’s the full query:</p>
<pre class="q"><code>q)select sum lista*c from inptab lj select c:count i by lista:listb from inptab
lista
-----
31</code></pre>
<h2 id="on-using-i">On Using <code>i</code></h2>
<p>You may have heard that using the implicit index column <code>i</code> in a query is slower than selecting a column explicitly defined in the table. While this is technically true, the impact on performance in most cases (including ours) is negligible. For example:</p>
<pre class="q"><code>q)\t:100000 select c:count i by listb from inptab
2512
q)\t:100000 select c:count lista by listb from inptab
2520</code></pre>
<h2 id="back-to-terse-land">Back To Terse Land</h2>
<p>Let’s return to our original non-table solution and explore what’s happening to each of the lists. The transformation process can be visualized like this:</p>
<p><img src="/NathanSwann/static/images/AOCD1P2Vis.png" style="width:90%;margin:auto;display:block;mix-blend-mode: multiply;"></p>
<p>In this approach, we transform list b into a mapping of frequencies while leaving list a unchanged. Conceptually, this involves applying the <strong>identity function</strong> to list a and <code>count each group</code> to list b. Using the <code>@</code> operator, we can pair each list with its respective transformation function:</p>
<pre><code>q)(::;count each group::)@&#39;inp
3 4 2 1 3 3
4 3 5 9!1 3 1 1</code></pre>
<p>For those not too familiar <code>::</code> here acts as an identity function, in the first case it is just returning list a while in the second part the <code>::</code> forces the chain of functions to act like a projection instead of KDB trying to execute it straight away. Another alternative would have been to do <code>'[count each;group]</code> however I find that syntax harder to parse. From here its fairly easy to do the rest:</p>
<pre class="q"><code>q)sum{x*y x}.(::;count each group::)@&#39;inp
31</code></pre>
<p>We can also use <code>count each group</code> in a single select statement rather than the left join in the previous solution and in fact it brings the performance more in line with list solution:</p>
<pre><code>q)\t:100000 select sum lista*c from inptab lj select c:count i by lista:listb from inptab
11525
q)\t:100000 sum{x*y x}.(::;count each group::)@&#39;inp
4352
q)\t:100000 select sum lista*(count each group listb) lista from inptab
4512</code></pre>
<p>With that, I’ve covered everything I tried or found interesting in today’s Advent of Code challenge. If you discovered a different approach or a unique insight, I’d love to hear about it!</p>

<h2 id="specialcase">Special Case For The Input (Credit: Krishan Subherwal)</h2>
<p>If you are keen eyed you may have noticed that for the input list a is completely unique. This means we dont need to compute the frequencies for part 2 at all but can instead sum the elements of list b that appear in list a like so:</p>
<pre><code>q)sum inp[1] inter inp 0</code></pre>
<h2 id="specialcase">Fixed Width Parsing (Credit: Cong Run Tay)</h2>
<p>Rather than using <code>vs</code> for parsing you can instead use <code>0:</code> with fixed widths:</p>
<pre><code>q)("JJ";4 1)0:read0`:data/1ex
3 4 2 1 3 3
4 3 5 3 9 3</code></pre>
